# Pluralith GitHub Actions

This repo contains a collection of Github Actions to run Pluralith in CI and post infrastructure diagrams as pull request or commit comments.
It currently contains three actions, we recommend running them in conjunction:

1. **Init** - `Pluralith/actions/init`
2. **Run** - `Pluralith/actions/run`
3. **Comment** - `Pluralith/actions/comment`

&nbsp;

### üìç The result looks like this:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Pluralith running in your GitHub Actions workflow:

1. Create a new Pluralith workflow file in your repo at `.github/workflows/pluralith.yml` _(View the full example at the bottom of this README to see how to structure a workflow YML file)_
2. Set `PLURALITH_API_KEY` as a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository). You can get your API Key through the Pluralith Dashboard.
3. Ensure Pluralith is properly configured. There are multiple options to do this:

    - Commit a valid [Pluralith Config File](https://docs.pluralith.com/docs/more/config) (pluralith.yml) to your repo
    - Set `PLURALITH_ORG_ID`, `PLURALITH_PROJECT_ID` and `PLURALITH_PROJECT_NAME` as [environment variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables) in your workflow.
    - Pass `org_id`, `project_id` and `project_name` directly as parameters to the **Pluralith Init** step.

4. Set credentials for the providers of your choice as repository secrets _(e.g. for AWS set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY`)_.
5. Set up Terraform and run `terraform init`. Hashicorp's `hashicorp/setup-terraform` action makes this a breeze. Check it out [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform) or copy the example below into your steps:

```yml
# Set up Terraform
- name: Setup Terraform
  uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
  with:
    terraform_wrapper: false # This is recommended so the `terraform show` command outputs valid JSON

# Init Terraform project
- name: Terraform Init
  run: terraform init
  working-directory: path/to/terraform/root
```

6. Set up and run Pluralith. Copy and paste the following three steps into your worflow:

```yml
# Set up and initialize Pluralith
- name: Pluralith Init
  uses: Pluralith/actions/init@v1.3.0
  with:
    terraform-path: "${{ env.working-directory }}/application"
    api-key: ${{ secrets.PLURALITH_API_KEY }}

# Run Pluralith to generate an infrastructure diagram and comment body
- name: Pluralith Run
  uses: Pluralith/actions/run@v1.3.0
  with:
    terraform-command: "plan"
    terraform-path: "${{ env.working-directory }}/application"
    show-changes: true
    show-drift: true
    show-costs: true # Requires Infracost to be set up in your pipeline

# Post the generated diagram as a GitHub comment
- name: Pluralith Comment
  uses: Pluralith/actions/comment@v1.3.0
  with:
    terraform-path: "${{ env.working-directory }}/application"
```

7. That's it! Create a pull request and see the magic happen in its comments!

## üì¶ Full AWS Example

If you are running AWS you can copy and paste the following into your `.github/workflows/pluralith.yml`. Adjust the paths to fit your Terraform project structure and you should be ready to go!

`This example assumes a valid **pluralith.yml** config file in your Terraform project's root directory` 

```yml
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  pluralith:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      working-directory: terraform

    name: Run Pluralith
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Set up AWS credentials (using the aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials action)
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_KEY }}
          aws-region: eu-central-1

      # Set up Terraform
      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
        with:
          terraform_wrapper: false # This is recommended so the `terraform show` command outputs valid JSON

      # Init Terraform project
      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init
        working-directory: "${{ env.working-directory }}/application"

      # Set up and authenticate Pluralith
      - name: Pluralith Init
        uses: Pluralith/actions/init@v1.3.0
        with:
          terraform-path: "${{ env.working-directory }}/application"
          api-key: ${{ secrets.PLURALITH_API_KEY }}

      # Run Pluralith to generate an infrastructure diagram and comment body
      - name: Pluralith Run
        uses: Pluralith/actions/run@v1.3.0
        with:
          terraform-command: "plan"
          terraform-path: "${{ env.working-directory }}/application"
          show-changes: true
          show-drift: true
          show-costs: true # Requires Infracost to be set up in your pipeline

      # Post the generated diagram as a GitHub comment
      - name: Pluralith Comment
        uses: Pluralith/actions/comment@v1.3.0
        with:
          terraform-path: "${{ env.working-directory }}/application"
```
